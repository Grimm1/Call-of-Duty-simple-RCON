Call of Duty Simple Rcon Thumbnail Creation

1. Open the included .psd file "srcon_thumbnail_template" in photoshop
2. Open the desired thumbnail image in photoshop. The image should be scaled to a height of 512 pixels. Adjusting width is not necessary but the image must be larger than 512 pixels wide.
3. With the rectangle marquee tool, select the part of your map image you wish to use that is at least 512x512. CTRL+C to copy selection.
4. Select the scron template, CTRL+V to paste. A new layer will be created.
5. Select the mask on the included layer, holding "ALT", drag the mask to your new layer. 
6. Right click on the effects portion of the included layer, select "Copy Layer Properties".
7. Return to the new layer, right click and "Paste Layer Properies".
8. Save the psd before proceeding. In the next few steps you will be reducing the thumbnail resolution. Saving this file in its 512x512 resolution is ideal if you plan to include additional thumbnails later. 
9. In the menu select Image>Image Size. 
10. Reduce image to 128x128, save as png using the proper mapname as the file name(mp_mapname.png). 
11. Move the 128x128 png to rcon/gamevars/map_images/(Call of Duty Version)
